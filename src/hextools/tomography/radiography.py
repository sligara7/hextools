"""
Radiograph acquisition plan for HEX beamline.

Equivalent of the old pyepics script:
    hex-acq-pyepics/techniques/tomography/kinetix/take_radiograph.py

What this plan does
-------------------
1. Check the front-end shutter and open the photon shutter.
   The front-end shutter is only checked at entry; must already be open — this
   plan never actuates it.
2. For each acquisition: fire ``num_images`` images, then wait
   ``time_gap``.
3. Close the photon shutter.

Everything from shutter-open onward runs under a finalizer, so an error or
interrupt still closes the shutter.

Trigger model
-------------
Each acquisition prepares the detector with a ``TriggerInfo`` capturing
``num_images`` images (each averaged over ``num_exposures`` exposures). The plan
owns the timing directly: ``exposure_time`` sets the livetime and
``acquire_period`` sets the frame period, so ``acquire_period - exposure_time``
is the readout margin (deadtime) that keeps frames non-overlapping — the same
"period larger than exposure" discipline the old PandA-paced script enforced
with its PULSE step. Set ``external_trigger`` to pace frames from an external
edge if precision frame timing is ever needed.

Usage
-----
    RE(take_radiograph(
        [kinetix1],
        exposure_time=0.5,
        num_images=10,
        num_acquisitions=5,
        time_gap=10.0,
    ))

``detectors`` is a list (``[kinetix1]``) since multiple detectors are supported.

Where files land is decided by each detector's path provider (set in the
profile), not by this plan — the old script's proposal-folder logic is gone.

    Parameters
    ----------

        detectors to trigger; any ophyd-async detector is accepted

        camera exposure time, in seconds (no default — depends on the sample)
    acquire_period : float, optional
        minimum time per frame, in seconds; must exceed ``exposure_time``, and
        the difference is enforced as the camera's deadtime. If None, computed
        from ``exposure_time`` plus a readout margin

        number of images to acquire in each acquisition
    num_exposures : int
        number of exposures to average for each acquired image
    external_trigger : bool
        whether to pace frames from an external edge instead of the camera's
        internal trigger
    num_acquisitions : int
        number of acquisitions to perform
    time_gap : float
        idle time between acquisitions, in seconds

        name of the sample being imaged
    md : dict, optional
        extra metadata to merge into the run's metadata
    use_shutter : bool
        whether to open/check the photon shutter during the scan
    fe_shutter : Shutter
        the front-end shutter to check before opening the photon shutter

        the photon shutter to open/close around the acquisition
