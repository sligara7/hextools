"""
Radiograph acquisition plan for HEX beamline.

Equivalent of the old pyepics script:
    hex-acq-pyepics/techniques/tomography/kinetix/take_radiograph.py

What this plan does
-------------------
1. Check the front-end shutter and open the photon shutter.
   The front-end shutter is only checked at entry; must already be open — this
   plan never actuates it.
2. For each burst: fire ``frames_per_burst`` frames, then wait
   ``wait_between_bursts``.
3. Close the photon shutter.

Everything from shutter-open onward runs under a finalizer, so an error or
interrupt still closes the shutter.

Trigger model
-------------
Each frame is acquired with ``bps.trigger_and_read`` using the camera's
internal trigger; the plan owns the exposure via ``prepare(TriggerInfo)``
(control screens just reflect it). Non-overlapping frames are guaranteed by
``deadtime = frame_period - exposure_time`` — the same "period larger than
exposure" discipline the old PandA-paced script enforced with its PULSE step.
A PandA-paced external-trigger variant remains possible if precision frame
timing is ever needed.

Usage
-----
    RE(take_radiograph(
        [kinetix1], fe_shutter, ph_shutter,
        exposure_time=0.5,
        frames_per_burst=10,
        num_bursts=5,
        wait_between_bursts=10.0,
    ))

``detectors`` is a list (``[kinetix1]``) since multiple detectors are supported.

Where files land is decided by each detector's path provider (set in the
profile), not by this plan — the old script's proposal-folder logic is gone.
